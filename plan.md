#### User Story 5: Granular Permission Management
**As a hafiz owner (parent or hafiz themselves), I want to:**
- Set default permissions for each relationship type (parent, teacher, student, family)
- Override default permissions for specific users when needed
- Grant different permission levels to different teachers for the same child
- Revoke or modify permissions as relationships change

#### User Story 6: System Setup & Seed Data
**As a system administrator, I want to:**
- Have sample teacher accounts available for testing
- Provide realistic sample data for different family structures
- Enable easy onboarding for new users

### Design Architecture

#### Database Schema Enhancements
```sql
-- Enhanced hafizs with better metadata
hafizs:
  - id (primary key)
  - name (string) - "Ahmed's Memorization Journey"
  - daily_capacity (integer) - pages per day
  - effective_date (date) - current position in schedule
  - user_id (foreign key) - the owner/creator
  - created_by_relationship (enum) - :self, :parent, :teacher
  - is_active (boolean) - for archiving
  - metadata (jsonb) - flexible additional data
  - timestamps

-- Enhanced relationship management
hafiz_users:
  - id (primary key)
  - user_id (foreign key)
  - hafiz_id (foreign key)
  - relationship (enum: :owner, :parent, :teacher, :student, :family)
  - added_by_user_id (foreign key) - who added this relationship
  - permissions_override (jsonb) - custom permissions per user
  - is_active (boolean) - for soft deletion
  - timestamps
  - UNIQUE constraint on [user_id, hafiz_id]

-- Permission system evolution
relationship_permissions:
  - Enhanced to support per-user overrides

### Implementation Notes

#### Development Approach
- **Test-Driven**: Write tests first for each user story
- **Incremental**: Each sprint delivers working functionality
- **User-Centric**: Regular testing with actual families/teachers
- **Data-Driven**: All decisions backed by user research and testing

#### Technical Considerations
- **Backward Compatibility**: Phase 3 doesn't break existing Phase 2 functionality
- **Migration Strategy**: Database changes are additive and reversible
- **Performance**: Optimize for common queries (dashboard loading, permission checks)
- **Mobile-First**: Design for mobile with desktop enhancement

#### Quality Gates
Each sprint must pass:
- [ ] All existing tests continue to pass
- [ ] New functionality has comprehensive test coverage
- [ ] UI/UX reviewed and approved
- [ ] Security review completed
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met
- [ ] Mobile experience validated

**Ready for Implementation:** This plan provides comprehensive specifications for autonomous development of Phase 3 without requiring step-by-step management.
